#How to Use
First, press "Load Images" to load an image from your photo gallery. (If you have no images, press "Download Images" to add some sample images).
Once you select an image, you can select from one of three different brushes from the "Brush" menu. (From left to right in the picture below: circle, square, circle splatter.)
